# City of Everlight

This name represents a city that emerged from the remnants of the shattered world, infused with the divine essence and serving as a beacon of hope and renewal. Everlight signifies the eternal presence of the divine in the city, casting a radiant glow over its inhabitants and symbolizing the rebirth of civilization in the wake of destruction.

## Overview 

In the center of the largest shard in this world stands the great capital city of Everlight, a sprawling metropolis that is home to thousands of people from all races and walks of life. At the heart of the city stands a massive stone structure, known as the "Pillar of Light", which glows with a brilliant energy that can be seen for miles around. The Pillar is infused with the Divine Essence, and it powers one of the most important machine in the world - the " Talent Forge ". 

The Talent Forge is a wondrous device that allows players to level up and specialize their skills with incredible speed and efficiency. Those who wish to become skilled warriors, mages, or craftsmen can use the Talent Forge to hone their abilities and gain new insights into their chosen craft. The device is incredibly complex and requires a steady stream of Divine Essence in order to function, which is why the Pillar of Light is so important to the city. 

In addition to the Talent Forge, the city of Arineth boasts a bustling trade area, filled with merchants selling goods from all corners of the shards. There are also numerous inns and other player accommodations, allowing visitors to rest and recuperate after a long day of adventuring or trading. Despite its size and importance, however, Arineth is not without its dangers. The city is home to numerous criminal organizations and dangerous creatures, and those who venture into its darker corners must do so at their own risk.
