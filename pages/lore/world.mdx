# World

The Divine Reborn is a sandbox fantasy-themed MMO set in a world that has been reborn from the ashes of a cataclysmic war. The war was caused by the demons, who exploited man’s greed and lust for power, and provoked the wrath of the gods. The planet has been broken into pieces, where life has found a way to continue and evolve. Man has also discovered the secrets of the divine power that flows through the world, and uses it to shape their destiny. The world has a strong resemblance to the Tenshō period of Japan, around 1570 to 1590, when feudal lords ruled over different regions and competed for supremacy. The culture, religion, and magic of this era are also reflected in the game world, where players can encounter samurai, ninjas, monks, and mages, as well as divine beings and demonic creatures. The game offers a rich and diverse sandbox experience, where players can explore, create, and interact with the world and its inhabitants.

## Regions
**The Shattered Lands:** The largest and most diverse region, where the remnants of the old world are scattered across a vast landscape. Here, players can find forests, mountains, lakes, deserts, and ruins of ancient civilizations. The Shattered Lands are also home to many factions and clans, who fight for resources and territory.

**The Divine Realm:** The highest and most sacred region, where the gods reside and watch over the world. Here, players can find temples, shrines, gardens, and palaces of divine architecture. The Divine Realm is also where the divine power originates from, and where players can learn to master it.

**The Abyss:** The lowest and most dangerous region, where the demons lurk and plot their revenge. Here, players can find caves, dungeons, swamps, and fortresses of demonic design. The Abyss is also where the demonic power corrupts and consumes everything, and where players can face the greatest challenges and rewards.

## Travel
**Walking or riding:** The most common and accessible method, where players can use their own feet or mount animals to traverse the terrain. This method is slow but reliable, and allows players to enjoy the scenery and discover hidden secrets along the way.

**Flying or gliding:** A more advanced and exciting method, where players can use wings, gliders, or flying mounts to soar through the sky. This method is fast but risky, and requires players to have enough skill and stamina to avoid obstacles and enemies in the air.

**Teleporting or portal:** The most convenient and expensive method, where players can use magic or technology to instantly travel from one location to another. This method is instant but limited, and requires players to have enough resources and access to use it.
