In a far distant future, the world as we know it had come to an end. The demons, fueled by humanity's greed and lust for power, had been able to start a Divine War that ultimately led to the destruction of our planet. As the dust settled, it became apparent that only small shards of the planet had survived, scattered across the cosmos. These fragments of land, each with their unique environments and ecosystems, would become the last hope for the survival of humanity. 

The survivors of the cataclysm were forced to adapt to these new environments, carving out a living on the small shards that remained. In time, they learned to extract the divine power that had once been wielded by the gods themselves, learning to harness it as their own. This newfound power, which they named the Divine Essence, became the cornerstone of their survival and prosperity. 

But with power came conflict. As different groups began to master the Divine Essence, they began to vie for control over the shards, each seeking to become the dominant force. Some used their power to build societies based on cooperation and mutual benefit, while others turned to oppression and tyranny, determined to wield the Divine Essence for their own gain. 

In the midst of this struggle, it was discovered that the demons had survived the cataclysm as well, and were seeking to manipulate the Divine Essence to their own advantage. As the power struggles between different groups escalated, it became apparent that the demons posed a significant threat to the fragile balance of power that had been established. 

The fate of the shards hung in the balance, as the conflict between the forces of good and evil continued to rage on. The survivors of the cataclysm knew that only through cooperation and unity could they hope to build a new world, one that honored the memory of the old world while looking towards the future.
