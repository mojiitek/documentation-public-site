# Our Commandments

Our principles; 'The Commandments' are a set of unbreakable rules all our in- and out of game systems, staff and company must follow or adhere to.

* **Transparency and integrity.** Transparency and integrity are two important values in game development. Transparency means being open and honest about the game’s design, development, and monetization. Integrity means being consistent and ethical in the game’s quality, content, and communication.

## Game

* All items are player made; monsters, npcs and other will always and only drop materials.
* Must adhere to **Bushnell's Law**; "*All the best games are easy to learn and difficult to master*. They should reward the first quarter and the hundredth." and **George Parker**; "Each game must have an exciting, relevant theme and be easy enough for most people to understand. *Finally, each game should be so sturdy that it could be played time and again, without wearing out*"
