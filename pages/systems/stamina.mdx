# Stamina and health

## Health

Your life essence, empty equals dead, plain and simple. You get hit, you loose health, you fall on your face, you loose health. You don't eat, you loose health. So to keep your health up you need to eat. Now depending on the food you eat; some food give you alot of health for a short period, some gives rapid regeneration while in combat. And some food givs you some of everything for a longer period of time.

## Stamina

Stamina dictates your characters ability to do perform tasks or actions; like running, blocking, attacking, etc. Staming and regen can be topped of by drinking. Works the same as food, some drinks will give you a fast power-up. While others will last you longer, but with a lesse effect. Stamina will regen depending on characters stats and beverages consumed. Standing still, or resting, will increase stamina regeneration.

### Example drink effects
* A potent beverage will give you a mjor boost in stamina and regeneration for 1 minute, but taper off quickly. Cooldown of this beverage is two minutes. Meaning you will need to use it very carfully, or performing any actions will be very difficult the last minute.
* A balanced beverage will give you a steady boost of stamina/regen for up to 3 minutes. Cooldown of this beverage is 5 minutes. Making it more sustainable for a longer time.
* A long-lasting beverage will gove you a base boost to staming/regen for a prolonged period of time, like 10 minutes. With no cooldown.
